# Abstract
Graft is a global, open-sourced, blockchain-based, decentralized payment gateway and processing platform that anyone can use. Any buyer and merchant can use Graft in a completely decentralized and inexpensive way. Graft ecosystem is open so anyone can participate by maintaining Graft blockchain and implementing network services.

Graft employs payment processing protocols and flows similar to traditional electronic payment systems such as credit,  debit, and prepaid cards, which are already familiar to and trusted by millions of users and merchants around the world. This approach enables easier and faster adoption of Graft as a mainstream payment platform, while eliminating the need in centralized intermediaries (payment gateways and processors) currently required to facilitate transactions between buyers and merchants.
